# I'm speechless.
#### I'm still thinking on how to speak about this book properly instead of just saying:

> "*Please buy the book and read it, whether you're a professional or not, because I feel like this book is worth having.*"


**Without a doubt, this is one the best books I've read**

I usually like to keep posts short and to the point, but with this book makes me want to nerd out and speak to my friends about the OOD I've learned and how awesome it is. In fact as of writing this post today, I've already told 3 different people what I learned and how it worked, because of how amazing I think it is.

Dependency Injections, Duck Typing, Object Roles, Single-responsibility Classes... You name it, this book has taught me that and many other things, and the best thing is I've not only understood each of them, but it has motivated me to try them out and make something.

Looking back to one of the projects I did while reading *Learn Ruby the Hard way*, specifically the command line game that I had to do from scratch, I can now see the mess of code that I made because of not knowing anything about Object Oriented Design.

 While writing that command line game, I did one or two things that Ms. Sandi's book mentions about OOD, such as very basic Dependency injections, however I did so unknowingly, thinking that what I was doing, while probably done in a bad way, was the best way I could code what I wanted at the time. <br> Once I reached the chapter regarding dependency injections, I learned that I was on the right path on some things, and on the wrong one with others, and so **the book proceeded to teach me how to do what I didn't know how to do, and how to improve at what I already did before.**

Without a doubt, I will have this book at my side every time I need to write code of any kind, filled with notes and highlights and many more things that I will review and peruse not only to refresh what I've learned but to also burn this knowledge into my memory as much as possible.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in OOP, but if you're a novice and you're new to the world of programming like I am, please get this book and read it. I cannot stress it enough, **get this book**. It will teach you so much in such an arguably short book. <br> If you're a professional programmer, you might not get much of it if you're in the ins and outs of OOD in your everyday life, but I recommend it to everyone none the less.

If people ask me about this book or how to learn OOD, I will always use the same answer:
>This is one of the best books I've ever read. Please, buy it.
