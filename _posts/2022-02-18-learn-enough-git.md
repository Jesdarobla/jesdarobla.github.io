To keep the post short, I'll write a summary of my opinion and experience with
the book.

#### If you're new to Git and want to learn the basics, this is a good book.

Overall the book is pretty short, but very well explained. It goes over the commands that will be the most used ones, along with an explanation on how to use them.

The book goes over several good practices on using Git, along with pictures and tables of used commands at the end of each chapter.

When I started this book, I only knew git existed, I have never used it because I never had the need to do so. But now that I'm becoming a developer, I needed to learn git.

Let me say that I really like git so far, I can already safely say that I've been saved several times by branches and commits when I made a huge mistake in the code I was writing and didn't know how to go back.

The book doesn't go over anything advanced, and in fact, it tells you to ask someone more experienced in git if you can't figure something out for yourself (or do a google search), so don't expect to go too much in-depth with this book, if at all.

I think the book is good, and it has taught me enough git to be dangerous.
