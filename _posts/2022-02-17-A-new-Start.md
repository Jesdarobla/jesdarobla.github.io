description: "A new start for me"

Like many people before have experienced and told others many times, sometimes it takes falling really hard at some point in your life to actually get an idea of where you want to go.

##### I wasn't in the right path.

Changing careers is new for me. I'm jumping from tech to tech so it is not as a big leap for me as it is for others, but it isn't less scary nonetheless.
However, I'm confident in my decision, and happy.

I was in a bad mental place in the past during my previous job. I felt lost for a long time because I didn't have a goal in mind, I just sort of got the job and thought I was done with my career. That's when I started to feel like everyday that passed felt like a lost day because I didn't work towards anything but my job.

Once I was done with my previous job, I felt lost and unsure of where to go or what to do. I realized that
I studied not because I enjoyed doing SysAdmin things but because I felt it would be the fastest way for me to
get a job, which was my only goal back then.

##### And so now I choose a path I enjoy doing.

After some time to think and a few failed interviews, it hit me. The thing I enjoyed about doing SysAdmin stuff was mostly related to coding of some sort. Some Bash Scripts here, some basic PHP and Javascript there.
I never really got into programming because, well, it just didn't happen. I had no interest in it at first.
But then I thought, well, since I don't really want to be a SysAdmin and I like programming, I'll just became a developer. I already had some really nice knowledge about data bases and Linux, I could just start studying programming from scratch.

And so I did, **I've completed two books so far**, one about **Ruby** (*Learn Ruby the Hard Way by Zed A. Shaw)* and one about **Git** *(Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous by Learn Enough).*
**I'm currently reading** *Practical Object Oriented Design* by Sandi Metz (A book I've definitely falling in love with.), the *Ruby on Rails Tutorial* by Learn Enough and *Well Grounded Rubyist* by David A. Black & Joseph Leo III.
I will go into more detail on what I think of the two books I've finished in separate posts.

I am in love with programming, even though it was always in front of me and never decided to try until now.
I love being able to think of something, and get it to work in my computer.
I want to read books and learn about it, something I could not say for SysAdmin before.
