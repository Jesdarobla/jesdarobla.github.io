I want to keep this post short to emphasize what I got out of this book after finishing it.

#### This book is great.

When I started to learn Ruby I went straight into an in-depth book, the *Well Grounded Rubyst*. Turns out at some point in the book I started to struggle and thought I may need another book first before finishing that one.

This led me to search for several books, but there was one in particular that caught my eye. *Learn Ruby the Hard Way* was done for people who were new to programming, explaining all the basics in a very good way.

#### The book actually taught me how to code.

When I *learned* programming languages in the past, I merely were memorizing the syntax without really understanding what to do with each keyword or how to use the language. It wasn't until I started this book that I actually got to learn syntax, and did exercises that would make me **think** how to use the syntax I had just learned.

The book goes over all the basics of Ruby and common programming knowledge and ideas. From simple things such as explaining how to set variables and how it works to more complex things such as making a command line game for yourself or creating a webpage with Sinatra.

One of my favorite exercises was creating the command line game from scratch. This was the first time I actually had to spend time thinking of design, how the game would work, how to code it and making it work properly. Honestly, it was a blast. I decided to create a **"horror" game** where the player would need to go through several rooms of their own choosing, inspecting items and getting keys to open more doors until getting out, all while a monster roams around and chases the player if the inspected items make noise.

If you're thinking about getting this book, just have in mind that it does not go over the advanced stuff. While I don't consider this "advanced knowledge", things like private, protected or public methods are not explained, for example.
It also doesn't teach you any guidelines on how to do better OOD, but again, this book's aim wasn't to teach you that, rather to teach you the basics of programming and Ruby.
However, if you're completely new in the programming world and want to start in it, this book is definitely for you.
